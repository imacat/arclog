    arclog archives the log files monthly.  It strips off previous months'
log records from the log file, and save them to compressed archive files
named logfile.yyyymm.  It then saves the hard disk space and prevents
potential attacks on log files.

    Currently, arclog supports Apache access log, Syslog, NTP, Apache 1 SSL
engine log and my own bracketed, modified ISO date/time log file formats, and
gzip and bzip2 compression methods.  Several software projects log (or can
log) in a format compatible with the Apache access log, like CUPS, ProFTPD,
Pure-FTPd... etc., and arclog can archive their Apache-like log files, too.
