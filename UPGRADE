Upgrade Instruction

    Here are a few hints for people upgrading from 2.1.1dev4 or earlier:

* The Script Name is Changed from arclog.pl to arclog

    This is obvious.  If you have any scripts or cron jobs that are running
arclog, remember to modify your script for the new name.  Of course, you can
rename arclog to arclog.pl.  It will still work.

    The reason I changed the script and project name is that:  A dot "." in
the project name is not valid everywhere.  At least SourceForge don't accept
it.  Besides, "arclog" is enough for a script name under UNIX.  The ".pl" file
name suffix/extension may be convienent for MS-Windows, but MS-Windows users
won't run it with explorer file name association anyway, and there is a pl2bat
to convert "arclog" to "arclog.bat", which would make more sense.  The only
disadvantage is that I use UltraEdit, which depends on the file name extension
for the automatic syntax highlighting rules.  But this is not much trouble.  I
can manuall set it anyway.


* The Default Installation Location Is at /usr/bin

    Also, the man page is at /usr/share/man/man1/arclog.1.  This is to follow
Perl's standard convension, and to avoid breaking ExtUtils::MakeMaker with
future versions.

    When you run "perl Makefile.PL" or "perl Build.PL", it will hint a list of
old files found to be removed.  Please delete them manually.

    If you saved them in other places, you have to delete them yourself.

    Also, if you have any scripts or cron jobs that are running arclog, remember
to modify your script for the new arclog location.  Of course, you can copy
arclog to the original location.  It will still work.


* The Argument of --keep and --override Options Are Required Now

    Support for omitting --keep or --override argument is removed.  This helps
avoiding confusion for the log file name and the option arguments.
